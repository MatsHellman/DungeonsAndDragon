# Dungeons And Dragons 
Personal repository for things I create for DnD. 

Welcome friend of DnD, this repository will hold some of the material I build for my players and you are welcome to use them according to the Creative Common license if you find them useful.  

For my map creation I use DungeonDraft mostly the Forgotten Adventures packs for DD. I will publish the maps I use in Fantasy Grounds.  

While I use Fantasy Grounds the maps should fit like a glove in any VTT, be it Roll20, Foundry or something I have not looked at yet.

## Maps
You can find my maps in the subfolder Maps. I will keep an index of what they contain in this readme file.  
For every map I create I will do one with and one without the grid. So pick the one you like.  

Grid size for now will always be 70x70, if I change it I will make a note of it to the map.

Maps below are listed as JPEG files but when I create maps that make use of Line-of-sight or dynamic lighting I will publish them in a zip file containing the basic image for those who prefer it and a version to use in Fantasy Grounds with LoS set on the map.

### LMoP Maps

- [x] LMoP - Goblin Ambush.jpg : the first actual encounter in the campaign. Simple JPG files and version with and without the grid.

- [x] LMoP - Old Owl Well.rar : Compressed file contains jpg, png, d2vtt files and Line of sight files for Fantasy Grounds.  

- [x] LMoP - Agathas Lair.jpg : Map for Agathas lair, it's a simple one so only JPG images and as always 2 versions, one with and one without a grid. 

- [ ] LMoP - Wyvern Tor.jpg : Missing map in the campaign so I will make my own.

The maps are a work in progress so check back later and they should be done.
