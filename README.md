# Dungeons And Dragons 
Personal repository for things I create for DnD. 

Welcome friend of DnD, this repository will hold some of the material I build for my players and you are welcome to use them according to the Creative Common license if you find them useful.  

For my map creation I use DungeonDraft mostly the Forgotten Adventures packs for DD. I will publish the maps I use in Fantasy Grounds.

## Maps
You can find my maps in the subfolder Maps. I will keep an index of what they contain in this readme file.  

### LMoP Maps
-[x] LMoP - Goblin Ambush.jpg : the first actual encounter in the campaign.  
-[ ] LMoP - Old Owl Well.jpg : Missing map in the campaign so I will make my own.  
-[ ] LMoP - Agathas Lair.jpg : Missing map in the campaign so I will make my own.  
The maps are a work in progress so check back later and they should be done.
